# NMS-MMM
A flight overhaul mod for No Man's Sky. Be prepared to fly differently. A lot of tweaks have changed how certain things feel (such as braking when flying towards the planet).

++ REQUIREMENTS

    - No Man's Sky NEXT


++ FEATURES: (GCSPACESHIPGLOBALS.GLOBAL)

    - Low flight including Underwater (recommend slow entry)    
    - Ability to reverse and hover including pointing straight down without auto corrections
    - 1x/2x/5x/10x pulse jump speed options
    - maneuverable boost and pulse jump cruise
    - warp in slightly closer to planet
    - can engage warp closer to station
    - boost distance near anomaly reduced to station distance
    - lower takeoff height and reduced delay before input
    - Optional: 5% Total fuel cost per launch (10% in survival), 1/5th the vanilla cost (10normal/5survival launches per fuel capsule)
    - increased allowed landing angle
    - increased max landing speed
    - increased shield recharge rate
    - increased delay before recharge to balance (from 3 to 5 seconds)
    - Optional: Removed auto speed brake
    - adjusted collision distances (reduced distance)
    - increased responsiveness of 3rd person camera follow
    - combat loot range GREATLY increased, hopefully no more missed rewards for combat (space/atmo ship battles)
    - Adjusted freighter entry beams slightly (less fighting to access middle pads)
    
++ INSTALLATION

    ** IMPORTANT ** Install only ONE .pak file at a time.
    
    1) Unzip file
    2) Choose the .pak file version you want
    3) Place the .pak file in your \No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS folder. If that folder doesn't exist, create it.
    4) Rename or Delete DISABLEMODS.txt from the PCBANKS folder.

++ KNOWN ISSUES

    When flying around at higher speeds near the ground/underwater you may pass through the ground.
    
        I believe it is caused by the way the game loads terrain, and the main reason they kept you so far away from it instead of fixing it with a rough projected collision instead of none-till-loaded (collisions generally take extra processing power even when not being impacted).
